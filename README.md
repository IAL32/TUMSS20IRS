# Seminar in Interactive Recommender Systems

## Letter to the professor

> Good morning,
>
> I am Adrian Castro, a student from the Data Engineering and Analytics MSc.
> I have launched a startup, a marketplace for food and beverage. Recommender systems are something that sometime in the future we will have to implement, and I want to know what advantages this techniques can bring to the company.
> 
> For this reasons, I'd like to also state my preferred three topics, in the case I get accepted to the course.
> * 1. Collecting Implicit and Explicit Feedback for Recommendations 
> * 6. Recommending and Presenting Sequences of Items
> * 11. Explanations and User Control in Recommender Systems
>
> Thank you for your consideration.

1. Collecting Implicit and Explicit Feedback for Recommendations (Adrian David Castro Tenemaya)

Many recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering need user ratings to recommend items. User ratings can be created by collecting explicit and explicit feedback. Explicit feedback, e.g., a user rating on a scale from 1 to 5 is very accurate but it demands an effort from the user. On the other hand, collecting implicit feedback is a bigger challenge but observing the user's browsing behavior or eye movements when interacting with a recommender system allows to identify recommendations that better satisfy the user's needs without annoying the user.
